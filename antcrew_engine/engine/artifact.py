"""Artifact: the unit of project state.

An Artifact is any piece of project output — a spec document, a source file,
a task graph, a test report.  It is identified by an ArtifactId (not by its
filesystem path), so storage is a detail of the ArtifactStore implementation.

ArtifactDelta describes what changed after a Capability executed.  The Store
applies the delta; the EngineLoop and Validators never modify artifacts directly.
