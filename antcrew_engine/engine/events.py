"""EventLog: the nervous system of the engine.

Every meaningful transition in the engine emits an Event.
The EventLog is the authoritative record — it serves observability,
replay, debugging, metrics, and UI without any component coupling
to each other.

Components emit events; they never call each other directly to
communicate state changes.

Subscribers receive events synchronously in emission order.
For async delivery, wrap in an async adapter at the subscriber level.
