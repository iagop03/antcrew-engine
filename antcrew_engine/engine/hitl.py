"""HITL contract — shared types between antcrew-engine and antcrew-platform.

These TypedDicts define the boundary between the engine's HitlReviewer
capability and any external review channel (platform API, CLI prompt, Slack).

The engine emits ``hitl_requested`` / ``hitl_resolved`` events (see events.py)
carrying these payloads.  The platform (or any other channel) consumes the
request and produces the decision.

Canonical flow
--------------
1. HitlReviewer calls ``request_review(content) -> HitlDecision``.
2. The channel (platform, CLI, ...) creates a review row / prompt.
3. The human (or automation) submits a decision.
4. The channel resolves the blocking call with a ``HitlDecision`` dict.
5. HitlReviewer writes approval/feedback artifacts and unblocks the EngineLoop.
